# Tests 

Tests are split up by use case/intention. 

* unit -- Unit tests against a specific component's input/outputs
* integration -- Integration tests of how two components interact
* systems -- System tests against a full stack of functionality
* acceptance -- Customer acceptance tests. These will not be included for this project

Each sub-folder will reflect the folder structure under `/src/typescript`.
