# Climbing Application

This is a climbing web application being built as a place to pour the things
I'm learning into. 

That is, the primary objective is basically sample code, and having a useful
climbing app is secondary. That being said, I do hope to introduce some novel
tools for crag exploration that could be modelled for other purposes.
